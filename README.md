# AP_Moller_Assesment

In this notebook, we utilized the following models:

Traditional Machine Learning (ML) Models:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Regression
Deep Learning Models:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks
Additionally, we explored an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for comparison purposes.

These models were employed to analyze the dataset and predict outcomes based on different modeling approaches.
